# Hackathon-AI

The project is to build an Autoencoder and then train the fashionMnist dataset upon it in pytorch.
Autoencoder is simply an unsupervised learning algorithm that learns the compressed representation of the input data by encoding it into lower dimensional latent spaces and then reconstructing it back to original spaces.This is done so as to minimise the difference between the original and reconstructed data, encouraging model to learn meaningful representations from the data, to make it even more precise, Variational Auto Encoders(VAE) are used.
And then task is to entangle the dataset.
The fashion mnist dataset can be entangled by using a technique called PCA(Principle Component Analysis) in this the dimensionality of dataset is reduced and and finds the principle componenet and explains the maximum variance in the dataset.
